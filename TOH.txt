Tower Of Hanoi problem. 
It is one of the main applications of recursion. 
This says "If you can solve n-1 cases then you can easily solve the nth case."

Base Case (if n=1)
Move the ring from A to C using B as base. 

Recursive Case
- Move n-1 rings from source(A) to spare pole(B).
- Move the nth ring from source(A) to destination(C)
- Move n-1 rings from the spare pole(B) to destination(C).
